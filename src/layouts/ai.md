If you're like me, you're probably not sold on LLMs as sufficient tech, or better than old-fashioned automation. To me, computers shine in their repeatability, and people shine in empathy.

I applied for a role for which I thought I was extremely well-suited, and relatively quickly got a rejection despite my cover letter. I was surprised; while it's normal to be rejected for (subjectively) arbitrary reasons, I had expected a bit more. I didn't want to resort to cheap tricks like "trying to fool AI", so I figured perhaps it was time to understand the game.

## Who are the players in the space?

Typically, what I've observed in applying for jobs is that a few parties are used. AI is the latest hot thing, so I figured their practices and methodologies were at least somewhat detailed for marketing purposes.

## Manual Tinkering

I wasn't getting conclusive answers here. So as a last ditch attempt, I thought about having my resume simply reviewed.

### General Review

### Specific Requirements

* Do I look like I've displayed impact?
    * Do I show the STAR method?
* Does this resume match? If so, why not?
    * Given this job posting, what are the skills required?

Some of these would be cheaper and simpler with simple text search, but
